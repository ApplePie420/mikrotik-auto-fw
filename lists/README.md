# The Lists
This folder contains text files with lists of CIDR IP ranges of multiple companies's public networks. These lists are compiled over time, and are mostly focused on hosting solutions, VPS, VMS, VUS, and other server renting solutions. The list is (for now) privately curated, with mostly companies that are widely known to cause problems.
