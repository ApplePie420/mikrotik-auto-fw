# The Lists
The folder `cidr` contains text files with lists of CIDR-noted IP ranges of multiple companies's public networks. These lists are compiled over time, and are mostly focused on hosting solutions, VPS, VMS, VUS, and other server renting solutions. The list is (for now) privately curated, with mostly companies that are widely known to cause problems. 

# Limitations
Because [networksdb.io](https://networksdb.io) currently has a limitation for querying only 1000 results from their website (full query requires paid plan), you'll see maximum of only 1000 entries in some files. Bear in mind that those __are not exhaustive and complete__, so you might want to find the rest by yourself, or wait for me to find a way to acquire them :)
